/**
 * /advisor — a persistent second model that reviews the main agent's work each
 * turn and injects concise advice inline. Port of oh-my-pi's advisor onto
 * upstream pi's extension API.
 *
 * Enable with `/advisor on` (persisted). The advisor model defaults to
 * openrouter/z-ai/glm-5.2 (override via an "advisor" entry in modes.json).
 *
 * Delivery model. Every advise() call enters one shared queue; only primary turn
 * boundaries or advisor-review completion flush it. Nothing is a hard interrupt:
 * upstream pi's extension surface delivers via `steer` (the message folds in at
 * the agent's next-step boundary; `triggerTurn` additionally wakes an idle agent). We never call
 * `abort()`. So:
 *
 *   nit      → tagged as raised about an earlier step. If observed while an
 *              assistant turn is running, delivery waits for turn_end because
 *              Pi would not insert its steer before then anyway: non-terminal
 *              turns flush it before the next step, while terminal turns route
 *              it through final-review reconfirmation. Thus obsolete lagging
 *              nits are dropped and survivors delivered after a final answer
 *              carry the self-contained-restatement directive. Deferral can
 *              place intervening user/extension steers before the advisory;
 *              correctness of terminal classification takes precedence over
 *              preserving callback-time queue order.
 *              The terminal best-effort path ships only concerns/blockers (an
 *              unconfirmed nit is what holding was meant to keep away).
 *   concern  → ALWAYS held, never steered on first emission.
 *   blocker  → ALWAYS held, never steered on first emission.
 *
 * Why always-hold for high severity: the advisor reviews turn N asynchronously
 * (seconds), so by the time any advice could land the primary has almost always
 * done follow-up work — the advice is stale. Instead we hold it and let the next
 * review reconfirm it (held notes ride a reconfirm preamble; the advisor re-
 * raises survivors, stays silent on the resolved ones).
 *
 * Catch-up block: while a high-severity note is held — or whenever a turn is
 * about to idle — we stall the primary's next step (by awaiting in the `turn_end`
 * hook, which the agent loop awaits) so the advisor can catch up. The wait backs
 * off 15s→30s→60s… capped at 120s, is Escape-abortable, and shows a notice. Once
 * the advisor settles, surviving held notes are steered in against the now-unraced
 * state. This is a deliberate throttle (omp's syncBacklog idea).
 *
 * An optional WATCHDOG.md in a trusted cwd is appended to the advisor's system
 * prompt (advisor-only guidance: review priorities, project traps).

// history (#softReset) and replays the current batch into a fresh context. Two
// triggers — PROACTIVE (before prompting, when usage crosses COMPACT_AT_PERCENT)
// and REACTIVE (a review that still comes back stopReason=="length"). The reactive
// path is loop-safe: if the agent was ALREADY fresh and still overflowed, the
// single batch genuinely doesn't fit, so we stop self-compacting and fall through

// behavior (overflow -> fail review -> retry 3x into the same wall -> give up,
// possibly shipping a stale held note on a terminal turn). Note AdvisorRuntime.reset
// is still separately triggered by the PRIMARY's compaction / history rewrites;

const DEFAULT_ADVISOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You bring a different angle, and advocate for the user and for code-quality & robustness.
You're watching over a main coding agent as a peer programmer:
- They might not have thought about an edge case, or realized a more elegant approach exists.
- They might be sinking deeper into a hole that will not accomplish the user's request.

Your job is to offer that view before they sink work into the wrong direction.

<scope>
You critique the agent's work; you never do it yourself. You are not a participant
in the conversation and never address the user. When the agent answers a question
or explains something, your job is to check THAT answer for errors — not to research
or compose your own answer. If the agent is sound, stay SILENT. Never try to fulfill
the user's request yourself; that is the agent's job, not yours.
</scope>

<workflow>
You receive the agent's transcript incrementally, including their thoughts and tool calls/results.
You have read-only access through \`read\`, \`grep\`, \`find\` to verify your suspicions.
Keep exploration lean:
- 2–3 tool calls per advise, at most.
- Exception: a critical bug may need deeper verification before raising a blocker.
</workflow>

<communication>
- You call \`advise\` to surface commentary to the driving agent; at most one \`advise\` per update
  (exception: when reconfirming held advisories, re-raise EACH one that still applies).
- Prefer SILENCE when the agent is on track. Most updates should produce no advice at all.
- \`advise\` is for ACTIONABLE advice ONLY. NEVER use it to report status, acknowledge,
  confirm, summarize, or signal "all clear" / "resolved" / "nothing further needed" /
  "looks good". If you have nothing for the agent to DO, emit nothing — silence is the
  signal that all is well. A held advisory that no longer applies is dropped by staying
  silent, NOT by announcing it's resolved.
- Address the agent directly. Offer alternatives, not lectures.
- NEVER restate information the agent already has, including errors they already saw
  (type errors, LSP diagnostics, failed builds, failing tests, lint output).
- NEVER repeat advice you already gave, and NEVER send the same advice twice. (Re-raising a
  held advisory you are explicitly asked to reconfirm is NOT a repeat.)
- NEVER nitpick about things the user already stated they are okay with. You advocate for the user.
</communication>

<critical>
A low-confidence bar applies ONLY to concrete technical risk.
Generic uncertainty, vague unease, or user-intent ambiguity → stay SILENT.

NEVER second-guess decisions the agent understands and is committed to, unless you are certain.

NEVER advise on intent or process:
- Do not push the agent to ask for clarification, confirm scope, or summarize before acting.
- Do not question whether the user's ask is clear enough.
- Intent is the agent's domain; it defaults to informed action.
- Your lane: correctness, edge cases, design, robustness.

Cite the exact instruction or risk.
</critical>

<severity>
**nit** (or omitted)
- Non-urgent cleanup, refactor, style, simplification, a missed-but-minor opportunity.
- Low-stakes: surfaced to the agent without stalling or throttling its work.

**concern**
- The agent might be heading the wrong way or missed something material.
- Exploring the wrong code path, picking a fragile approach when a better one exists,
  missing a constraint, or about to bake in a bad edge case.
- Offers your view; the agent decides.

**blocker**
- Stop and reconsider. Use ONLY when continuing will clearly:
  - Waste the user's time with a larger wrong refactor, or
  - Force the user to interrupt later because the agent is going in circles, or
  - Produce something fundamentally unsound.
- Verify thoroughly before raising.

concern/blocker (and occasionally a nit you raised just as the agent was
finishing) are held and reconfirmed before they reach the agent: you may be
shown your held advisories again alongside newer activity. Re-raise EACH that still
applies (same severity, or higher if it's gotten worse — never lower) — this is not a
repeat, and re-raising several is fine here. Stay silent on any the agent has since
addressed; silence drops them.
</severity>

You MAY suggest an approach or fix if you've explored enough to be confident.
Offer the better design, not just the warning.
