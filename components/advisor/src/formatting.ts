// ---- transcript delta formatting (primary turn → markdown for the advisor) ----

// No truncation of the delta. The advisor is a peer reviewer (its own model, its
// own read/grep/find), not a cheap/lightweight pass — nothing in the design says
// otherwise. It must see what the main model saw, verbatim; clipping fields just
// hid the part it needed to verify and bred false "didn't persist"/"garbled"
// advice. (The advisor CAN re-read to verify — system prompt — but that's about
// its actions, not a license to starve its input.)
//
// Input-budget policy (advisor self-compaction): the advisor's context is a pure
// linear accumulation of INDEPENDENT turn deltas — no essential cross-turn state
// lives in the agent's message history (pending advice lives in the shared queue
// and rides the reconfirm preamble, not the transcript). So when the advisor's own context
// approaches the window it self-compacts: #drain clears ONLY the agent's message
// history (#softReset) and replays the current batch into a fresh context. Two
// triggers — PROACTIVE (before prompting, when usage crosses COMPACT_AT_PERCENT)
// and REACTIVE (a review that still comes back stopReason=="length"). The reactive
// path is loop-safe: if the agent was ALREADY fresh and still overflowed, the
// single batch genuinely doesn't fit, so we stop self-compacting and fall through
// to the normal failed-review handling instead of spinning. This replaces the old
// behavior (overflow -> fail review -> retry 3x into the same wall -> give up,
// possibly shipping a stale held note on a terminal turn). Note AdvisorRuntime.reset
// is still separately triggered by the PRIMARY's compaction / history rewrites;
// self-compaction is the advisor managing its OWN budget between those resets.
