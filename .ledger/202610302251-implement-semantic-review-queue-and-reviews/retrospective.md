# Retrospective

## What Mattered

In progress. The capture foundation was exercised before any paid reviewer turn. Preserve the distinction between this checked component and the still-pending runtime and operator-facing experience.

## Learnings

Git's virtual empty-tree handling hid a missing stored object until full artifact verification ran. A root-commit capture needs a materialized empty tree, not only a resolvable ID. The capture context file owns that invariant.

A checkout-scale measurement exposed process-per-blob acquisition as the dominant cost: 353.7 seconds for 4,930 files. Git batch acquisition retained identical source and patch identities in 21.4 seconds, including verification. These single observations justify the changed I/O boundary, not a general latency or review-quality claim.

## Improvements

Pending completion of the undertaking.
